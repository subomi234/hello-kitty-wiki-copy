                <p>
                    Hello Kitty (ハローキティ, Harō Kitī), also known by her full name, Kitty White (キティ・ホワイト, Kitī Howaito), is a fictional character produced by the Japanese company Sanrio, created by Yuko Shimizu, and designed by Yuko Yamaguchi. She is the titular main character of the long-running and highly successful Hello Kitty media franchise as well as Sanrio's longtime mascot. Hello Kitty made her grand debut in 1974 and is therefore one of the company's earliest known characters. She is also the primary protagonist of the universe named after her. Kitty is portrayed as a female anthropomorphic white Japanese Bobtail cat with a red bow worn on her left ear and usually wears blue overalls with a yellow shirt. Unlike some other Sanrio characters, though she does speak, Hello Kitty famously does not have a visible mouth (with the exception of some animated series).

                    On Hello Kitty's first official appearance in 1975, despite her design is rather basic by current standards (which most later popular Sanrio characters would follow), the character was revolutionary for an era where the kawaii community was at its infancy, and Kitty's groundbreaking success also made herself become the image of "kawaii", taking the world by storm, especially Japan. Although other early successful mainline characters released during this period such as My Melody (her best friend) or Little Twin Stars also play a factor, she is primarily responsible for what made Sanrio as a whole become the multi-billion dollar company known today since. Therefore, Hello Kitty is one of the most globally recognized and important characters of all-time among the likes of Mario or Mickey Mouse, the mascots of Nintendo and The Walt Disney Company, respectively.

                    When asked about the purpose of Hello Kitty's creation and why she serves as the mascot of Sanrio, founder and former president Shintaro Tsuji personally stated "I felt that the most important thing in your life is to have someone whom you can open up your heart to and talk about anything; to have many friends whom you can talk with your heart is the most blessed thing in your life. Then I asked myself how can you make friends -- in what way people can make a friend with those people. That is not just to avoid behaving, which makes people uncomfortable. But do something, which makes people happy. In this way people can make friends. For example, when people are ill, you can say something to them, or when people did something for you, you say "thank you" to them. For those kinds of occasions, you send a small present rather than an expensive gift. It is important to show your appreciation since you are able to make good friends in this way. This idea has formed as a business. As a result, Hello Kitty was created. Hello Kitty has become known among everybody and it means that people are becoming friends. I am pleased with this phenomenon."

                <p>
                    In addition, Shintaro explained that Hello Kitty herself has a meaning of three messages: The first is you should be loved and be nice to others to be loved yourself, second, her signature red bow represents human connections and people should get along with each other, and lastly, the character rarely having a mouth is people need to express with actions and not only by words.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    While the majority of her official character profiles call her "Hello Kitty" or just "Kitty", her real name is Kitty White, and she was born in the suburbs of London, England[1] on November 1st. Her height is five apples and her weight as three apples (although various media depict much larger sizes).
                </p>
                <p>
                    She is portrayed as a cute, bright, sweet, pure-hearted and tomboyish girl who can do anything she sets her mind to. She has many friends such as My Melody and she is very close to her slightly younger identical twin sister Mimmy. Kitty is good at baking although she claims that she is an awful chef in the Hello Kitty and Friends episode "The Wonderful Sisters". She loves her Mama's homemade apple pie. Kitty likes to collect small and cute things. Her favorite subjects in school are English, music and art, and she dreams of becoming a pianist or a poet someday. Her blood type is A. Hello Kitty's trademark signature is the red bow on her left ear.

                <h3>Age</h3>
                <p>
                    Like some other mainline Sanrio characters, Hello Kitty has an ambiguous age that is inconsistent across various Sanrio media; For example, although her appearance is unchanged as with her friends, in The Adventures of Hello Kitty and Friends she is in kindergarten to around 1st grade and in Hello Kitty and Friends she is in 3rd grade, while other media such as Hello Kitty and Friends Supercute Adventures shows Kitty and most of her friends old enough to own both a house and store and be independent, suggesting an adult age. On the other hand, in Hello Kitty Super Style!, although she already lives in an independent house like in the former series, Kitty is not seen working, so it is most likely she would be in some type of university degree. In Hello Kitty Ringo No Mori although Hello Kitty lives with her family, she does not seem to be studying like the aforementioned two series, once again implied to be a younger age like most other media.

                <h3>Yuko Shimizu</h3>
                <h4>Creation</h4>
                <p>
                    In 1962, Shintaro Tsuji, the founder of Sanrio, began selling rubber sandals with flowers painted on them. Tsuji noted the profits gained by adding a cute design to the sandals and hired cartoonists to design cute characters for his merchandise. The company produced a line of character merchandise around gift-giving occasions. Hello Kitty was designed by Yuko Shimizu and was added to the lineup of early Sanrio characters in 1974. When a front and side drawing of Hello Kitty (then unnamed) was shown by Yuko to several other people in the company, they greatly preferred the side view drawing and praised it. When Shintaro Tsuji had first seen Hello Kitty, he himself didn't really have any strong opinions about the character, but warmed up to her later on. Needless to say, Hello Kitty would almost immediately become the most important creation by Sanrio.
                </p>
                <h4>Product Debut</h4>
                <p>
                    The character's first ever appearance on a product was a vinyl coin purse in Japan released in 1975, which ended up being the hottest selling item that year which came as a surprise to everyone. Its artwork shows Hello Kitty in her iconic side-view sitting position with blue overalls but no shirt, with a bottle of milk and a fish in a bowl on her left and right, respectively. Notably, the original says "Hello!" above, but later reproductions by Sanrio instead says her familiar name. Yuko Shimizu came up with a backstory for her character and dubbed her Kitty, after the name of the protagonist’s pet cat from her favorite book, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Hello Kitty was introduced in the United States in 1976, a year after her debut in Japan, her popularity continued to boom throughout 1977. However, Yuko Shimizu left in the previous year, as she had gotten married and focused on family in the meantime.
                </p>
                <h3>Setsuko Yonekubo</h3>
                <p>
                    Shimizu’s former assistant, Setsuko Yonekubo, oversaw Kitty during the boom years. She introduced incremental innovations like the first portrayal of Hello Kitty in a standing pose, but otherwise made a point of hewing closely to her predecessor’s linework, down to using a photocopied template of Kitty’s face to ensure uniformity. Whether because of this conservative approach or because of the ever-changing whims of young children, the first Kitty fad ran out of steam around 1979. Yonekubo took the opportunity to announce her own retirement, for she wanted to start a family of her own.
                </p>
                <h3>Yuko Yamaguchi</h3>
                <p>
                    For a long while afterwards, Sanrio made no particular effort to replace Hello Kitty's designer. When Tsuji had learned of the team planning to abandon Kitty, he fought to keep her and decided to hold an in-house competition for new concepts for Hello Kitty. The winner was Yuko Yamaguchi, with her whimsical illustration of Hello Kitty sitting at a piano surrounded by an adoring family—a charming visual of a deeper backstory that had previously only been hinted at by Yamaguchi’s predecessors. She was awarded the post of Hello Kitty’s chief designer in 1980, and continues to be the character's designer to this day.

                    Since her debut, Hello Kitty, like many fellow popular Sanrio characters, can easily be found on a wide variety of consumer products ranging from plushies, school supplies to fashion accessories and even food. These products range from everyday items to rare collectibles. Sanrio's official website (https://www.sanrio.com/) is where you can find a variety of items and many other cute things such as phone backgrounds, paper crafts, and more.

                    As of 2009, Bank of America began offering Hello Kitty-themed checking accounts, where the account holder can get checks and a Visa debit card with Hello Kitty's face on it. MasterCard debit cards have featured Hello Kitty as a design since 2004.

                <p>
                    Sanrio and various corporate partners have released Hello Kitty-branded products, including the Hello Kitty Stratocaster electric guitar (since 2006, with Fender in the US) and even an Airbus A330-20 commercial passenger jet airliner, dubbed the Hello Kitty Jet (2005–2009, with EVA Airways in Taiwan).
