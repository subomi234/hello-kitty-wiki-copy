                    Hello Kitty (ハローキティ, Harō Kitī), also known by her full name, Kitty White (キティ・ホワイト, Kitī Howaito), is a fictional character produced by the Japanese company Sanrio, created by Yuko Shimizu, and designed by Yuko Yamaguchi. She is the titular main character of the long-running and highly successful Hello Kitty media franchise as well as Sanrio's longtime mascot. Hello Kitty made her grand debut in 1974 and is therefore one of the company's earliest known characters. She is also the primary protagonist of the universe named after her. Kitty is portrayed as a female anthropomorphic white Japanese Bobtail cat with a red bow worn on her left ear and usually wears blue overalls with a yellow shirt. Unlike some other Sanrio characters, though she does speak, Hello Kitty famously does not have a visible mouth (with the exception of some animated series).

                    On Hello Kitty's first official appearance in 1975, despite her design is rather basic by current standards (which most later popular Sanrio characters would follow), the character was revolutionary for an era where the kawaii community was at its infancy, and Kitty's groundbreaking success also made herself become the image of "kawaii", taking the world by storm, especially Japan. Although other early successful mainline characters released during this period such as My Melody (her best friend) or Little Twin Stars also play a factor, she is primarily responsible for what made Sanrio as a whole become the multi-billion dollar company known today since. Therefore, Hello Kitty is one of the most globally recognized and important characters of all-time among the likes of Mario or Mickey Mouse, the mascots of Nintendo and The Walt Disney Company, respectively.

                    When asked about the purpose of Hello Kitty's creation and why she serves as the mascot of Sanrio, founder and former president Shintaro Tsuji personally stated "I felt that the most important thing in your life is to have someone whom you can open up your heart to and talk about anything; to have many friends whom you can talk with your heart is the most blessed thing in your life. Then I asked myself how can you make friends -- in what way people can make a friend with those people. That is not just to avoid behaving, which makes people uncomfortable. But do something, which makes people happy. In this way people can make friends. For example, when people are ill, you can say something to them, or when people did something for you, you say "thank you" to them. For those kinds of occasions, you send a small present rather than an expensive gift. It is important to show your appreciation since you are able to make good friends in this way. This idea has formed as a business. As a result, Hello Kitty was created. Hello Kitty has become known among everybody and it means that people are becoming friends. I am pleased with this phenomenon."

                    In addition, Shintaro explained that Hello Kitty herself has a meaning of three messages: The first is you should be loved and be nice to others to be loved yourself, second, her signature red bow represents human connections and people should get along with each other, and lastly, the character rarely having a mouth is people need to express with actions and not only by words.

                    While the majority of her official character profiles call her "Hello Kitty" or just "Kitty", her real name is Kitty White, and she was born in the suburbs of London, England[1] on November 1st. Her height is five apples and her weight as three apples (although various media depict much larger sizes). She is portrayed as a cute, bright, sweet, pure-hearted and tomboyish girl who can do anything she sets her mind to. She has many friends such as My Melody and she is very close to her slightly younger identical twin sister Mimmy. Kitty is good at baking although she claims that she is an awful chef in the Hello Kitty and Friends episode "The Wonderful Sisters". She loves her Mama's homemade apple pie. Kitty likes to collect small and cute things. Her favorite subjects in school are English, music and art, and she dreams of becoming a pianist or a poet someday. Her blood type is A. Hello Kitty's trademark signature is the red bow on her left ear.
